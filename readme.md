Treemapr
========

Treemapr will be an easy-to-use tool that allows people to create treemaps. Here's the basic workflow:

1. Upload and prepare your data
2. Customize your treemap
3. Export the treemap

Import will accept JSON, XML and CSV. Users must describe the structure of their uploaded data.

Customization will include treemap layout algorithm, colors, labeling, maximum nesting depth.

Export will include bitmap (JPG, PNG) and vector graphics (PDF, SVG) as well as ready-to-use interactive apps based on open source visualization libraries such as d3.js and RaphaelJS.
